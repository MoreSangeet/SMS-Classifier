# SMS-Classifier

The SMS Classifier project is an internship project aimed at developing a robust machine learning model for classifying Short Message Service (SMS) messages into predefined categories. The goal is to create an efficient and accurate system that can distinguish between different types of SMS, such as spam and non-spam (ham). 

Project Objectives :-
*Text Preprocessing: Implement a thorough text preprocessing pipeline to clean and prepare the SMS data for model training.
*Machine Learning Models: Develop and evaluate multiple machine learning models for SMS classification. This may include traditional models like Naive Bayes and more advanced models like neural networks.
*Evaluation Metrics: Assess the performance of the models using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
*API Implementation: Build an API to facilitate easy integration of the trained model for making predictions.

Dataset :-
The project utilizes a dataset containing labeled SMS messages. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets to facilitate model development and evaluation.
